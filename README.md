# Sample gitpod repository
[Duplicate this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) and open it with gitpod. 

To rename your project, simple rename the .csproj file to `your-project-here.csproj`, then edit ` .theia/launch.json`'s `program` property to `"${workspaceFolder}/bin/Debug/net5.0/your-project-here.dll"`.

Then, do whatever you like.

Repository duplicated and modified from [here](https://github.com/gitpod-io/dotnetcore).
